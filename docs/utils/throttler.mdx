# `throttler`

If you are going to do a lot of requests at the same time, you are likely to exceed our rate limits.
To help you with this, we have a `throttler` utility that throttles the requests in order to respect the rate limits.

Example usage:

```javascript
import createEnturClient, {
    throttler,
    convertFeatureToLocation,
} from '@entur/sdk'
// or: const { default: createEnturClient, throttler, convertFeatureToLocation } = require('@entur/sdk')

const enturClient = createEnturClient({
    clientName: 'myawesomecompany-myawesomeapp',
})

async function getTripPatternsForVeryManyDifferentLocations() {
    const [fromLocation] = await enturClient.getFeatures('Oslo S')
    const [toLocation] = await enturClient.getFeatures('Drammen stasjon')
    const params = {
        searchDate: new Date(),
        from: convertFeatureToLocation(fromLocation),
        to: convertFeatureToLocation(toLocation),
    }

    // A huge array of arguments that we want to call a function with, one by one.
    const queries = Array(3000).fill(params)

    // We pass the function and the huge list of arguments to the throttler.
    // The resulting list will be in the same order as the arguments passed.
    const tripPatterns = await throttler(
        (query) => enturClient.getTripPatterns(query),
        queries,
    )
    console.log('Done!')
    return tripPatterns
}
```
